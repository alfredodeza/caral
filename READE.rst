Caral
=====
`caral` is intended to be a very flexible PyPi mirror. Why would you ever want
to use yet-another-pypi-mirror ? well, this is easy, `caral` gives you the
following features:

* Whitelist/Blacklist packages from mirroring.
* proxy-like behavior, if you request a package that `caral` does not hold it
  goes and fetches it for you on the background, it redirects you to PyPi while
  it does this. You don't get an immediate 404.
* Command line tool to upload custom/private packages.
* Permission-based upload and management of the package repository.
